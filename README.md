The Travel Diaries application is a full-stack web platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The system is designed to provide travel enthusiasts with a digital space to document, manage, and share their travel experiences in the form of personalized travel diaries.

The application incorporates a secure user authentication mechanism that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts safely. Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page, where they can explore a curated collection of travel stories shared by other users on the platform.

Users can create their own travel stories using the Add Story feature by providing a title, detailed description, travel images, and location information. Each story is displayed in a card-based layout, and users have complete control over their content, including the ability to delete their stories at any time.

To enhance trip planning, the platform includes a dedicated Hotels section, which categorizes accommodations into 5-star, 4-star, and 3-star hotels. Each listing provides essential information such as hotel name, location, pricing, images, and a brief description. A search functionality enables users to filter hotels based on name or location across India.

An innovative Mood Tracker feature further personalizes the user experience by analyzing users’ emotional input and recommending travel destinations that align with their current mood. This feature adds an emotional intelligence layer to the application, transforming it into both a travel planning tool and a personal travel companion.

The Travel Diaries application features a modern, responsive user interface to ensure a seamless experience across different devices. Overall, the platform integrates social sharing, travel planning, and emotional intelligence to foster a vibrant travel community while demonstrating key full-stack development concepts such as authentication, CRUD operations, and RESTful API integration.
